# TASK
Imagine you need to add 4 pairs of 32 bit numbers.

- Build a 32 bit adder using 4*8 bit adders (cascading). Estimate the total time required to add 4 pairs

- Build a 32 bit adder using 4*8 adders using pipelining so that each 8 bit adder can start working on a subset of different pairs


 This Exercise it to showcase the power of parallelism. By doing this I observed that it took 6 clock cycles for parallel adder and 8 clock cycles for serial adder.
