# Radix-4 Multiplier

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a radix-4 multiplier written in SystemVerilog. A radix-4 Booth's algorithm is used to optimize multiplication, reducing the number of partial products and leading to faster performance in hardware-based multipliers. This module is parameterized and can handle input bit widths defined at compile time.
